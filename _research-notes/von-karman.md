During this project, the fluid flow over cylinder was observed at different Reynolds number ranging from 5 to 3.5e6. The effect of Reynolds number was analysed to observe the behavior of von karman street over different flow regimes.

## Visualization of Von Karman Effect

## Von-Karman Effect
In fluid dynamics, Von karman effect is a common vortex effect in which there is a repeating pattern of swirling vortices which are caused by the process called vortex shedding. These vortices are responsible for unsteady fluid flow separation around blunt bodies.

## Calculation of the Reynolds Number

<div style="width=100%;height=100%;"> 

$$ Density ~ of~  air (\rho ) = 1.225 ~ kg/m^3 $$ 
$$ \\ Kinematic ~ viscosity ~ of~  air (\mu)  $$
$$ \\ = 1.4607^{-5} ~ m^2/s $$
$$ \\ Characteristic ~ length (L)  $$ 
$$\\= Dia. ~ of ~ Cylinder $$ 
$$\\ = 200 ~ mm$$
$$ \\ Reynolds ~ Number (Re) = \frac{\rho \times V \times L}{\mu} $$
$$\\ \approx 16773 \times v$$

Here, The velocity used in the simulation was $$ 0.156 m/s $$ which results in the Reynolds number $$\approx 2617.$$
