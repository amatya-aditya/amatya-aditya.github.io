  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles possess characteristics that make them suitable for use in multiple areas. This project proposes the design of a small fixed-wing UAV that can be used to carry a payload of around 1 kg. The design is developed performing aerodynamic, structural, and stability analysis using analytical methods as well as commercial code. It is then fabricated into a physical model. Take-off is achieved by launching with the hand or a launcher. Low stall speed allows the UAV to land softly during landing. Twin vertical stabilizers are used, one at each end of the horizontal stabilizer, to reduce the effect of propeller slipstream. Pusher configuration is chosen to allow unobstructed view when imaging devices are attached to the nose of the UAV.},
